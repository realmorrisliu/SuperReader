# Roadmap

## 1. Feasibility spike

Done on 2026-11-03. PDF is pdfium. EPUB is the system WKWebView. UNDER RE-EVALUATION (2026-11-10). Morris wants to consider a fully native, pure-Rust EPUB implementation on NSH, for cross-platform reach and full control of layout. Research is in progress. PDF via pdfium-render is unchanged. The comparison, including why hayro lost on text, is in `docs/spike/report.md`. No product features in this step.

## 2. Verification skill

Add the verify-superreader skill with `/create-verification-skill`, so later changes are checked against the goals and the walkthroughs.

## Core

The library, SQLite annotations, tantivy, and the `superreader` command with JSON output. Writes from that command are applied by the running app, because alan's Seatbelt sandbox denies writes outside mounted directories.

## Reading

Done on 2026-11-03. A single-page PDF and EPUB reader on NSH v0.4.0. PDF pages are pdfium through pdfium-render, and that choice is unchanged. EPUB pages are WKWebView. UNDER RE-EVALUATION (2026-11-10). Morris wants to consider a fully native, pure-Rust EPUB implementation on NSH, for cross-platform reach and full control of layout. Research is in progress. The publication's type and layout win. The page box uses the saved trim, or the book's own page size when it declares one. The default trim is paperback, 129 by 198 mm, picked by Morris. 32开 and US Trade stay as the other choices. Pinch zoom and Command zoom re-render the page. Highlights hang off the spike's anchor. No spread, and no night mode.

The reading window landed on 2026-11-04. It is the page, with the lights and the book title fading in at the top. The footer is in the page margin. Full screen scales the page and the type together.

The paper is Books-white `#ffffff`. There is no cream or yellow paper. The chrome and the toolbar are the same white as the page, the way Apple Books' white theme reads as one sheet.

The Knuth-Plass pass is in the EPUB page. It chooses line breaks and the space between words. Font, size, line height, indent, and alignment stay. `SPIKE_JUSTIFY=0` leaves every paragraph native. A paragraph with CJK stays native. 朝花夕拾 and the plain Chinese fixture report `owned` 0 and `forbidden_starts` 0 at paperback, 32开, and US Trade.

`scripts/verify` scored one release run on 2026-11-04. The record is `docs/verify/summary.json`. The run is `docs/verify/runs/20261103T183652Z`. With the pass off, the Pride opening was loose. Paperback `gap_p95` was 3.108 on 10 justified lines, 8 of them over 1.5, with 1 river. 32开 `gap_p95` was 3.599 on 10 justified lines, all 10 over 1.5, with 1 river. `docs/design/justification/before.json` stores that census. The breaker is given the column's content width: the page width minus the padding in the page sheet, `max(14%, (100% - 48ch) / 2)`. On the settled paperback that width is 383.78 px, and a DOM measure of "acknowledged" matched the canvas measure at 138.4 px. `box_err` is the distance between that box and the box the paragraph actually laid out in. It was 0 at every English trim. Each non-last owned line meets both edges within 0.25 px. An earlier pair of screenshots compared the opening frame, about 505 by 775 px and 9 pages, with the settled frame, 534 by 819 px and fewer pages. The pass was the only thing still invalidating the view after the title fade, so only the fitted shot reached the settled frame. Both shots are the settled frame now. At that frame native Pride is 8 pages and the pass is 7, because the breaks fill the same measure more evenly. Pride, whole first chapter: paperback p95 1.359 max 1.491, 0 of 59 loose, 6 of 59 hyphenated, flush 0.23. 32开 p95 1.386 max 1.489, 0 of 62 loose, 6 of 62 hyphenated, flush 0.25. US Trade p95 1.379 max 1.482, 0 of 60 loose, 7 of 60 hyphenated, flush 0.25. Rivers and overflow were 0. The unstyled English fixture, also the whole chapter: paperback 9 of 76 hyphenated, p95 1.379. 32开 5 of 57, p95 1.355. US Trade 9 of 67, p95 1.377. The widest hyphen share is 13.4 percent. The 15 percent check stays. A line may start with an intact `——` or `……`. A comma, a period, or a split pair still counts.

`OWN_PUBLISHER` stays false. A separate run, with that constant temporarily true, opened the Literata fixture whose own sheet sets justify. Paperback failed at p95 3.421 and max 3.421, with 4 of 12 lines loose. US Trade failed at p95 2.105 and max 2.368, with 3 of 12 lines loose. 32开 passed at p95 0.789, with 0 of 10 loose. `docs/design/justification/publisher-own.json` stores that run. The verify summary still expects `owned` 0, because the constant in the tree is false.

A later open reads line breaks from `~/Library/Application Support/SuperReader/breaks/<book>.json`. The key is the book hash, the chapter href, the paragraph index, the content width, the first-line width, the font, the indent, the language, and the incoming hyphen run. The breaker waits until the web view is within 1.5 px of the settled page width, so a reopen is not keyed off a frame from the window animation. Paragraphs the breaker leaves to WebKit are stored too, or the next open would run `breakLines` again for them. `reading-warm-cached` requires `break_source` `cached` and `live_calls` 0. It is not the 300 ms bar.

There is one web view. `SPIKE_NEXT=1` loads the next chapter into that view after the open chapter's layout is done, and `chapter_ms` is that load. `scripts/verify` sets `SUPERREADER_SUPPORT_DIR` to a temp directory for that run.

On the release run in `docs/verify/summary.json`, the one-minute load at start was 9.7, with no other `spike-shell`. During the opens it was 15 to 35. Cold open max 1076.6 ms, median 952.7 ms. Native on that interleave was 881 to 990 ms. Warm open max 1093.3 ms, median 928.0 ms, and all five fitted samples were `cached`. Native on that interleave was 883 to 1070 ms. The cached reopen in `warm_phases` spent 3 ms applying breaks, 355 ms to finish navigation, and 555 ms after navigation before the page was ready. `page_ready_ms` was 910. The 300 ms bar is that whole `page_ready_ms`. Applying the stored breaks is 3 ms. Navigation finishes in 355 ms, and the page is ready 555 ms after that. The same web view then loads the next chapter. Fitted `chapter_ms` max 39.1 ms, median 35.7 ms, at load 14.8. `summary.json` `ok` is false because cold open and warm open stay over 300 ms.

WKWebView remains the EPUB page until an owned pure-Rust typesetter passes. This run keeps the line-break cache.

Pretext, chenglou/pretext, waits until figure placement.

## Comments

The comment UI is chosen from two or three prototypes. A highlight can carry the reader's note. `@alan` in that note runs the handoff below.

## @alan

Blocked on the external dependency. When the gate is open, `@alan` spawns a fresh one-shot `alan` process with the passage, the note, the earlier comments, and the question on stdin. SuperReader stores stdout as alan's reply. The spawn does not pass `--resume`. The comment shows a thinking state until the whole reply lands.

## External dependency

Owner: Morris. The work is assigned to him on [alan issue 1078](https://github.com/realmorrisliu/alan/issues/1078).

alan needs a launch flag or mode so that a reader-spawned run does not rewrite its global root-rollout pointer. Today every launch rewrites that pointer. A reader-spawned launch would replace Morris's next `alan --resume` session.

Status: pending.

Gate: confirm [alan issue 1078](https://github.com/realmorrisliu/alan/issues/1078) is closed and the flag has landed before the @alan milestone starts. The change lands in the alan repository. This repository does not carry that patch.

## Distribution

WKWebView _setBackgroundColor: SPI, revisit before any Mac App Store build.
