# Goals and hard principles

SuperReader replaces Apple Books for Morris. The agent features matter equally with reading. Ask, explain, or translate a selection. Summarize a chapter. Search across the library. Let other agents read the library and the notes.

The product is opinionated. Settings stay few, and Morris's taste decides.

## Hard principles

No theme switching, and no night mode, ever. A reader with night mode is unacceptable.

Single-page reading only. There is no two-page spread, and there is no setting that turns one on.

The liked reference is Apple Books on one page of 《穷查理宝典》. The toolbar carries the book title. The footer shows the page as `590/1146` and the pages left in the chapter.

The disliked reference is the same book as a two-page spread.

## Stack

The app is pure Rust on NSH, pinned at v0.3.0, macOS first. LLM calls go through [openrouter-rs](https://github.com/realmorrisliu/openrouter-rs). Annotations live in SQLite. The full-text index is tantivy. AGPL dependencies stay out, including MuPDF. The GPL `epub` crate stays out. EPUB parsing uses rbook.

## Agents and alan

Other agents, alan included, reach the library and the notes through a `superreader` command that prints JSON, plus a skill. An MCP server is a thin wrapper later, and only for clients that cannot run a terminal.

alan's bash runs under a macOS Seatbelt sandbox that denies writes outside mounted directories. A `superreader` write is applied by the running SuperReader app. The command does not open the database itself.

Picked on 2026-11-03. SuperReader owns the library, the SQLite annotations, tantivy, the comment threads, and the comment UI. alan is not linked into the reader process, and SuperReader does not speak alan's socket protocol. On `@alan` in a comment, SuperReader spawns a fresh one-shot `alan` process and pipes stdin. The body is the passage, the user's note, the earlier comments in the thread, and the new question. SuperReader reads stdout and writes that text into its own SQLite as alan's reply comment. The spawn does not pass `--resume`. The annotation id and the thread id live in SuperReader. The reply arrives whole, not streamed, so the comment shows a thinking state until the reply lands.

The comment UI itself is still open. Two or three prototypes will decide it later. The spike only has to leave a stable anchor that a comment thread can hang on.

alan needs a launch flag so a reader-spawned run does not rewrite alan's global root-rollout pointer. That flag is an external dependency. See the roadmap. This repository does not patch alan.

## Decision log

- 2026-11-03. No night mode, and no theme switching.
- 2026-11-03. Single-page reading only. The spread in the disliked reference is out.
- 2026-11-03. alan is a one-shot process with piped stdin and a whole stdout reply, as written above. Embedding alan, and alan's socket protocol, are out.
- PDF renderer and EPUB layout engine stay open until `docs/spike/report.md` records the measurements.

## Measurable bars

`docs/spike/report.md` writes the number future work has to beat. The metrics are time from open to the first page, PDF scroll frame time, and EPUB page-turn frame time. A frame budget of 16.7 ms is the line for scroll and for a page turn. A highlight drawn from its anchor still lines up after a zoom re-render. The report fills the open-to-first-page bar from the measured runs.
